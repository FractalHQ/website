For over a hundred years Moquettes have been used on public transport all over the world. There is a good chance that you have sat on a Moquette covered seat, I am as I write this now. Moquettes are a super durable woven fabric, that's hard to stain. This makes it the perfect material for the millions of passengers that need somewhere to sit. The history of the Moquette is interesting since, while it's a dull topic at first glance, they're integral part of our transport network is built.

## Manufacturing

The word Moquette comes from the french word for carpet, where it was originally hand woven. It's even still produced using traditional techniques in Yorkshire UK. It's made from about 85% wool with the rest being nylon, and woven using the Jacquard technique.

Moquettes for London Transport take time to make, just a meter of the Moquette fabric used on the Bakerloo Line requires nearly eleven kilometres of yarn. The yarn is dyed different colours and transferred to over 3000 bobbins ready to be put through a loom. The new fabric is then steam finished, and cropped to give it a crisp and clear face. Finally it's soaked in a flame retardant solution before being dried out and sent off to be used on our transport network.

## Designs/Patterns 

My favourite thing about Moquettes are the designs/patterns used. Getting the design right is paramount to the transport experience. It's mind blowing how the right combination of patterns and colours can effect the mood of your travel. The added benefit of the Moquettes design is that it makes it harder to see the wear and tear you naturally get over time.

## A brief history

I am going to specifically focusing on the patterns seen in London since it's probably the most well documented use, going all the way back to the 1920s. The first Moquette pattern was called Lozenge, and was commissioned by the Underground Group in 1923. It became the standard pattern and was produced by three major Moquette manufacturers.

### Routemaster Moquette

In the 1950s Douglas Scott was commissioned to design the now iconic Routemaster busses, with the first prototype being created in 1954. He carefully chose the colours of the interior and in 1961 a Moquette featuring the maroon, yellow, and green of the interior was introduced.

### The Victoria Line

Professor Misha Black worked as the design consultant for the Victoria Line in 1964. Marianne Straub, Jacqueline Groag and the Orbit Design Group were comissioned to create some new Moquette designs for the line, unfortunately, the designs were never used due to time pressures. Some preexisting blue and green designs were used instead, and featured both on the rail and road.

### The Moquette Identity

During the 1990s the London Underground experimented with giving each line it's own Moquette design, rather than using pre-existing designs on it's trains. The designs attempted to incorporate the colours of both the line and carriage, similar to the work Douglas did for the Routemaster bus. For example the following design was using on the red branded Central Line.

### Moquettes Today

The designs/patterns and colours of Moquettes have changed over time but the tradition of distinctive designs still lives. It's always a treat to go on a new train or bus and see the Moquette designs used, and think of the amount of people who helped create the atmosphere of the vehicle you are in.

## My Favourite Moquette

My favourite Moquette design was made around 2011 and still features on the District (Green), Circle (Yellow), Metropolitan (Magenta), and Hammersmith & City Lines (Pink). It's design is simple but beautiful, bringing together the four colours of the lines it serves. It's a amazing easter egg for those enthusiasts or regular travellers of those lines.
